  A central part of organizational life is creative idea generation. Yet, voicing creative ideas represents another type of vulnerable organizational communication, as employees risk rejection and navigate uncertainty about whether their suggestions will be valued or dismissed. In a new line of research, I am proposing a ‘simplicity paradox,’ whereby decision-makers prefer simple solutions yet paradoxically undervalue the individuals who propose them, favoring instead those who suggest complexity.

  Decision-makers in organizations are being encouraged to develop new and improved ways of doing things by simplifying processes (Anderson et al., 2014); for instance, “Invent and Simplify” is one of Amazon’s leadership principles (https://www.aboutamazon.com/about-us/leadership-principles). But choosing simplicity can be complex: When it comes to making improvements, people tend to search for additive, rather than subtractive transformations, thereby complicating matters further (Adams et al., 2021). In my ongoing research (along with Rachel Ruttan and Henning Piezunka), I introduce and empirically investigate an overlooked challenge for organizations hoping to reduce the friction in their organizations. Drawing from the literature on the hindsight bias (Fischhoff, 1975), I argue that, although cultivating simplicity can be complex, decision-makers prefer, yet undervalue, simple solutions because they seem predictable and inevitable in hindsight. 

  This paradox carries important implications for organizational creativity and innovation. Organizations frequently seek straightforward ways to reduce inefficiencies and improve processes; however, if the simplicity paradox persists, it may unintentionally incentivize unnecessary complexity and discourage employees from offering clear, elegant solutions. Preliminary findings from three laboratory experiments support the notion that simple solutions are perceived to be more effective and likely to be selected. At the same time, those who suggest simple solutions are rated as less competent – and given less of a monetary reward – compared to those who suggest complex solutions.  
  Moving forward, I am currently investigating the communicative strategies that problem-solvers employ when expressing a simple solution to examine if different ways of communicating simplicity (e.g., highlighting effort), moderate the extent to which decision-makers give credit, recognition, and value to those who suggest simplicity.
