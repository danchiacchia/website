  My job-market paper, “Sympathy Expressions Are Less Effective When They Focus on the Silver
  Lining,” unpacks a paradox of communication whereby the most compassionate individuals may
  be the most likely to adopt strategies that backfire. Integrating insights from emotional-
  labor theory (Hochschild, 1983) and the interpersonal process of compassion (Dutton et al.,
  2014), I argue that well-intentioned individuals, driven by heightened feelings of
  compassion, often try to alleviate another’s distress by redirecting their attention to the
  potential positive aspects or benefits of their situation (e.g., “Look on the bright
  side…”). However, this seemingly supportive strategy unintentionally pressures recipients
  to engage in surface acting, compelling them to mask their genuine emotional experiences.
  This has important downstream consequences; silver-lining expressions undermine authentic
  emotional processing, producing poorer relational (e.g., less perceived supervisor support)
  and psychological (e.g., greater distress) outcomes.

  Across several studies—including an archival analysis of 600 sympathy cards, observational
  data from over 1,000 interactions, and lab experiments involving 500 grieving
  individuals—I consistently find robust support for this paradox. By unpacking the black
  box of sympathy expressions, my job-market paper challenges the assumption that “anything
  is good” when it comes to compassionate action, revealing how well-intentioned strategies
  can produce unintended harm.

  It also highlights a selection paradox: organizations may choose the most compassionate
  individuals to deliver bad news or offer comfort even though their conversational
  strategies may be less effective. In ongoing work, I extend this research to medical
  contexts, examining whether felt compassion predicts the provision of false hope during
  life-altering diagnoses and whether organizations systematically select such communicators
  despite the ethical and relational costs.
